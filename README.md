These projects , help us understand basic issues that appear while programming with threads. There are 4 exertcises , in each one
we implement different algorithms. We use basic and complex algorithms.We coded in C language . After finishing this project, 
each one lasted 2 weeks, we understand how to solve problems while threads run the same part of code the same time, especially using 
locks.

More info , to be updated..
